 <center>Welcome to H A N I M O O N</center>

## About

The best way to find success is to discover what you love, strive to learn all you can, and seek to make even small positive changes in the world. My passion for learning, my unwavering enthusiasm and motivation, and my strong work ethic have rendered me an efficacious learner. Art is not my profession, it is my desire. Whatever you see in this personal blog are either what I have drawn for myself  or my  penchant for photography. I have not educated in art, and these are all my self experience which I like to share with others. For more posts you can also visit Hanimoon on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/haniii_mooon/)

Please contact me if you have any comments for my works.
